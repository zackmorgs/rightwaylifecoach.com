                She is the wife of Tim Morgenthaler, MD, a practicing pulmonologist specializing in sleep medicine, and
                together they have lived the realities of medical training and practice for more than forty years. For
                the past 25 years, they have made their home in Rochester, Minnesota, where Tim practices at Mayo
                Clinic. Robin and Tim are parents to five grown children and grandparents to five—a role Robin treasures
                deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Robin trained as a nurse, her primary vocation for four decades has been serving her family and
                creating spaces where women can grow, connect, and flourish. That calling took clear shape in 1987, when
                God gave her a vision—one that would eventually become Side By Side, a Christ-centered ministry for
                women in medical and dental marriages.
            </p>
            <p>
                What began in 1988 as six resident wives gathered around Robin’s kitchen table in Rochester has grown,
                over 37 years, into a global ministry with more than 90 chapters, serving over 1,500 women and 600
                children across the United States and multiple countries. From the beginning, Side By Side has welcomed
                women of diverse backgrounds and theological perspectives, united by a shared desire to look to Christ
                for strength, wisdom, and perseverance in the medical journey.
            </p>
            <p>

                Through decades of listening, praying, teaching, and walking faithfully with women, Robin has gained a
                deep understanding of the challenges and quiet pressures faced by women connected to medicine—frequent
                transitions, long hours, vocational uncertainty, and the call to hold family, faith, and identity
                together with grace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Robin brings that same steady presence into Christian coaching. Her approach is relational,
                discerning, and grounded in Scripture. She creates a thoughtful space where women can reflect honestly,
                listen for God’s leading, and take intentional steps forward—without being rushed, fixed, or told what
                to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Robin’s heart remains what it has always been: to come alongside women, side by side, as they seek to
                live faithfully and well in the lives God has entrusted to them.

                <h2>Why I Coach</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                I coach because I have seen, again and again, what can happen when a woman is given space to be heard,
                to reflect honestly, and to listen for God’s voice in the midst of a full and demanding life.
            </p>
            <p>
                For decades, I have sat with women as they navigated uncertainty, transition, and calling—often while
                carrying significant responsibility for others. Many of these women were strong, capable, and faithful,
                yet unsure how to move forward with clarity and peace. What they needed was not advice or fixing, but a
                trusted partner who would walk alongside them, ask thoughtful questions, and help them notice what God
                might already be stirring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Christian life coaching allows me to do exactly that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coaching creates a focused, prayerful space to slow down, discern, and act. It honors both faith and
                responsibility. It respects your agency while inviting attentiveness to the Holy Spirit. Over time, I
                have seen women gain confidence, make wise decisions, and step more fully into the lives God has
                entrusted to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I coach because I believe God is still calling, still guiding, and still at work—and because no one
                should have to listen for that call alone.
